Are you looking for a way to make a difference in the world, learn new skills, and have some fun? If so, you should check out hackathons!

Hackathons are events where people come together to build software and solve problems. They can be in-person or online, and they range in size from a handful of people to hundreds of people.

Hackathons are a great way to learn new skills, network with other developers, and build projects that can have a real impact on the world. They're also a lot of fun!

## About

Solana Hyperdrive is a hackathon for developers to build projects on the Solana blockchain. The hackathon is five weeks long and the winners will receive prizes and have the opportunity to pitch their projects to investors. The judges are a panel of experts from the Solana community. 

If you are a developer, I encourage you to participate in the Solana Hyperdrive hackathon. It is a great opportunity to learn about the Solana blockchain and build innovative projects.

Don’t be afraid to build or put your work out there in the open. You need to build a shitty app to get to a great one. It’s like going from 0 to 1.

I believe in you. All the best :)
